# .dotfiles
This is a central place to store my nvim developer experience setup.
This repo is to manage my vim experience in a single repo so that I can clone the repo to any machine then stow the contents to have my setup of nvim on any linux distro.

## Prerequisites
- Lua
- Neovim
- Stylua
- Nerdfonts
- Stow (for install script)
- Ripgrep (Telescope `live_grep` depends on it)


## TODOS
[] Add auto imports for golang - The packages should automatically be imported after being called in the methods.
[] Add git actions - Push, Pull, Stash, Rebase
