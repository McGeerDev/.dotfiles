# gaussian elimination

A way of solving [[linear equations]] to get them in the simplest for possible. Getting **augmented matrices** in [[Identity Matrix]] from is called the **reduced row echelon form** of the matrix.

**Row echelon** form is when the top 'half' of the matrix (above the diagonal ones) is non zero values. Where **reduced row echelon** is equal to an [[Identity Matrix]].
