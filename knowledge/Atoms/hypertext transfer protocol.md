## Http is a client server model
For example I am the client at a McDonalds, Mcds is the server that serves me after I made a request. This is otherwise know and a request response model [API](Application Programming Interface)

## Http is stateless
Like flipping a coin or [[pure functions]]

> You could flip a coin 10 times and every time get a heads. But it doesn't affect the odds of getting either a head or tails on the next toss.

## Http Communication
Uses [[CRUD]] system to communicate from the client to the server.

## Http headers
Header are extra bits information that is sent by either the client or the server. An example of a request header from the client is the *content type* which tells the server what format to send the response in.
