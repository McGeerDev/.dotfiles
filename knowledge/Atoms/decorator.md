Decorators are functions that add functionality to classes/objects. By wrapping the class/object in a special wrapper. Usually preceded by an @ sign.



##### Similes
Like clothing add functionality to us. 
As a naked person I can still perform human functions (Eating, Walking, sleeping etc).
Clothing add cold resistance to the naked human class.

Can be seen as buffs to a game character. Like a temporary river speed boost (Dota) or a jungle attribute boost to add to stats or a shop item that extend abilities of the base character.
