# linear equations
Linear equations are equations where the unknowns are in the first order and non of the unknowns are roots or trigonometric equations or logarithmic.

Examples of linear equations:

$$ \displaylines{ x + 3y = 7, \\  \frac{1}{2}x -y + 5z = -1}$$

A finite set of linear equations is called a **system of linear equations** or a **linear system**.
A **linear system** is **consistent** if it has at least 1 solution. And **inconsistent** if it has no solutions (0 or infinitely many).
Every **linear system** has 0 solutions. 1 Solution or infinitely many solutions.

If a **linear system** has infinitely many solutions we set the solutions in terms of arbitrary unknown variables (usually t) called [[parameters]]
