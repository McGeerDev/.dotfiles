Using your 5 senses to observe a system to recognise patterns.

Coding example [[for-loop]]

```typescript
for(let i=0;i<5;i++){
	console.log('i',i);
}
```

Application:
console.log() is a function - by the round brackets.
console.log() is within the scope of the [[for-loop]] - by the indents and curly brackets
console.log() will display a string i and the variable i that is controlled within the scope
i is a variable initialised on every call of this for loop - by the let keyword
i is initialised to 0
i is incremented until it equals 5 then the loop would stop - because 5 is not < 5
i would be incremented 1 at a time. - by the ++ sign.
the programming language used for this loop is [[typescript]]
