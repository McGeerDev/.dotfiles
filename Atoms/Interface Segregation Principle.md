# Interface Segregation Principle
#### Or Interface Seperation Principle

ISP is like [[Microservices]] such that responsibility(Interface) is split up. If multiple users consume an interface then that interface should be split up so that each user isn't required to update and recompile their entire application bacause an unrelated part of the original interface changed.
