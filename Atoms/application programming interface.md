# Application Programming Interface

An interface is a connection point where two systems, clients, organisations, meet and interact with one another.


Real world examples of interfaces:
- Wall socket connects the user to the electrical grid so that we have a way of interacting with the electrical grid. If we plug a kettle into the socket, we use only a part of the entire electrical grid and the wall socket allows us to do so. Within certain parameters.
- TV remotes connect the user to the the television so he/she can select channels
- Wifi is an interface that connects
